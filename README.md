This project was initiated as an online assignment that was given by some rando company to test backend skills.Obviously, i had missed the deadline for submission a long time ago as i was lazy and had other priorities. Now i am determined 
to finish it fully (fullstack) and then deploy it by Q4 2025. Also another great progress tracker.
You guys can use it as a tutorial to implement authentication in your fastapi applications. As shitty the code maybe, i believe it can be a great tool to learn and understand how basic authentication in any web application works. Feel free 
to clone and share as you wish. Happy hacking :)
